Automatic Masternode tools focused on my main project Transcendence. Feel free to use and fork any code here, with due credits.

Lobohub.sh is a Transcendence exclusive automatic node creator with features like auto update and version checking.

Check releases for my closed source automatic node multi-node creator that works with virtually any coin with API support. It's features include:
- Adding coins to System database, so it can create nodes in batch almost instantly
- Creating multiple nodes of the same coin or from different coins on the same system, using ipv6 (Required for more than 1 node per coin)
- Easiest usage possible extremely noob-friendly
- API support from the command line for node hosting services. run `node help` for a list of commands (IP configuration must be done manually)

How to install:
`wget https://github.com/lobomfz/Masternode-tools/releases/download/v1.0/node`

`chmod +x node`

`mv node /usr/local/bin`
